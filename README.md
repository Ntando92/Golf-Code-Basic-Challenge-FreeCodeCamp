This is a basic challenge that can be found on FreeCodeCamp; it's a byproduct of one of the certification courses I was doing - months back. In this challenge we had to compile some code that would calculate and evaluate the score a golfer achieved while playing to score by getting the ball into the hole.

So the value that goes by name of par determines the number of strikes a player needed get the ball into the golf hole. The value of strokes determines the number of strikes the player was allocated to succeed.

So the code that I have written applies a certain equation that deals with both figures -- the stroke and the par -- and generates a final title to label the score with.

The coding was a bit of a challenge at first, but in the end... I solved the puzzle and got it right!

Some of the code was automatically generated by the FreeCodeCamp system, but for most of it, I had to write on my own.

Love watching my coding skills develop every day.
